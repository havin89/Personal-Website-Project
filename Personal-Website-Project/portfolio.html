      My friends and I are working on a podcast that explores a wide range of topics that we are interested in, including psychology, business, economy, mythology, literature, and philosophy. Alongside the podcast, we are also developing a channel and a website to share our content. Our creative process includes discussing and refining ideas together, writing introduction and episode scripts, and reviewing everything as a group. We plan the order of episode releases carefully to ensure a smooth flow. Once finalized, we move on to recording. Our goal is to create thoughtful and engaging content that sparks curiosity and encourages deeper thinking.

        In support of the Social Equality Network (TEA), an NGO that my friends founded, I took part in and helped organize an informative and entertaining workshop for children with different mental and physical disabilities. As a part of the workshop and the NGO, our goal was to support the children's cognitive and social development through fun, engaging activities like painting, music, and educational games. We included silent English films and rhythm exercises to help them learn basic English concepts interactively. We carefully planned the event to meet children’s diverse developmental needs and made sure all materials were safe and inclusive. By the end of the workshop, the children had a joyful experience and learned new things, all while we deepened our understanding of empathy and social responsibility.
