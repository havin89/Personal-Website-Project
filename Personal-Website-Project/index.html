      <p class="homewriting"> My name is Havin C., and this is my personal website.
        I'm 16 years old and was born and raised in Turkey. I would describe myself as a creative and introverted person who enjoys exploring different ideas. I love winter, the cold weather, cozy clothes, and cold drinks. I also love caramel-flavored things. I have a dog and a cat, who bring me a lot of joy and comfort.
        Some of my favorite hobbies are drawing and listening to music. Music helps me focus, relax, and sometimes even sparks new ideas. I also enjoy learning about random topics like mythology, psychology.
        In the future, I hope to study computer engineering abroad. Most of what I know about coding so far comes from self-paced learning and personal curiosity.

        Feel free to explore my portfolio to learn more about me and see what Iâ€™ve been working on!
